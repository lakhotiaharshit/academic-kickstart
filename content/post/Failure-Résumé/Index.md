This is a list of rejections and setbacks. I came across this idea in the [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html) article. The rationale behind doing this is that you learn much more from your failures than success. 

### **My Journey Before Microsoft - 2019**

*While the end destination was a promising role at Quantum Research at Microsoft, the journey was riddled with both trials and insights.*

- **Flow Traders Interview for Quantitative Researcher Role**  
  **Lesson**: Never underestimate the importance of fundamentals.  
  My miss on a multivariate regression problem during the interview underscored the value of revisiting basics before interviews. It fortified my preparation for subsequent roles and highlighted areas for growth.

- **Shell Graduate Program Application**  
  **Lesson**: Embrace uncertainty and always seek feedback.  
  Despite not receiving specific feedback, I was reminded of the unpredictable nature of job applications and the importance of proactive communication.

### **PhD Odyssey at LMU - 2014 to 2019**

*My half-decade endeavor at LMU was not just about research but also a deep dive into personal growth and perseverance.*

- **Developing Imaging Technique for Crystalline Solids**  
  **Lesson**: Success isn't instantaneous; patience pays.  
  The initial years were taxing, especially without any first-author paper to my name. It taught me resilience, persistence, and the ability to find light even in seemingly bleak situations. My dedication finally bore fruit with a publication in Nature in 2020.

### **Before My Days at MPQ - 2014**

*With dreams of delving into optics, the universe had its own plans to test and guide me.*

- **US University Applications**  
  **Lesson**: Rejections aren’t reflections of capability.  
  Facing rejections from several prestigious institutions, including the University of Colorado Boulder and UIUC, was tough. But it instilled a belief to keep pursuing what I wanted and not to settle. 

- **Swiss Excellence & EPFL Acceptance**  
  **Lesson**: Timing is everything.  
  Although the joy of the Swiss Government Excellence Fellowship came a bit late, it reinforced the idea of patience and making informed decisions, especially since I already committed to MPQ.

- **Georgia State University Offer**  
  **Lesson**: Sometimes waiting offers a better perspective.  
  Almost settling for Georgia State University, I realized the importance of patience and the belief in better opportunities on the horizon.

### **Before Embracing IISER, Kol - 2009**

*My aspirations always leaned towards pure sciences, but the universe had its unique way of teaching resilience.*

- **Initial Stint at NIT Srinagar, Kashmir**  
  **Lesson**: Setbacks can be setups for greater achievements.  
  After an initial stumble at the entrance examination in 2008, I had a brief foray into engineering. But my passion for science drew me back, and I successfully secured a spot at IISER Kolkata in 2009, one of the premier science institutes in India.
