This is a list of rejections and setbacks. I came across this idea in the [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html) article. The idea behind doing this is that you learn much more from your failures than success. 

Here I have listed chronologically major success in my life and under each success you will find a set of failures. At the end I have placed failures which did not lead to any success. Also those failures are not places in any chronological order.

### 2019 Microsoft
I applied to many industries finally getting offer to work for Quantum Research at Microsoft.

- Got rejection from Flow traders for quantitative researcher position. In the final round of interview I was unable to solve a problem on multivariate regression. This was great opportunity missed. I made sure to revise the basics of the field I applied in for interview since this application.

- Got rejected for Shell graduate program. Do not know why. Did not receive any feedback on my application. 

### 2019 PhD Physics, summa cum laude, Ludwig Maximillian Universität

I started my Ph.D in July 10th, 2014. I ended on April 4th, 2019. During these 5 years I worked on a single major project and 1 side project.   

### 2009 
This is one of the best schools for studying science in India. 

*However, before getting into this one. I studied engineering for a year at NIT Srinagar, Kashmir, India. You must be wondering, why? So here is my first big failure in life. After high school, I started preparing for Joint- Entrance-Examination for the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT). Around 400 thousand students appear for the exam conducted for around 7 thousand seats. I failed this test in 2008*
