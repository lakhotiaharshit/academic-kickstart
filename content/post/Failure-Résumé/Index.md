This is a list of rejections and setbacks. I came across this idea in the [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html) article. The rationale behind doing this is that you learn much more from your failures than success. 

Here I have chronologically listed major success in my life and under each success you will find a set of failures. At the end I have placed failures which did not lead to any success. Also those failures are not places in any chronological order.

#### 2019: Before Microsoft
I applied to many industries finally getting offer to work for Quantum Research at Microsoft.

- Got rejection from Flow traders for quantitative researcher position. In the final round of interview I was unable to solve a problem on multivariate regression. This was great opportunity missed. I made sure to revise the basics of the field I applied in for interview since this application.

- Got rejected for Shell graduate program. Do not know why. Did not receive any feedback on my application. 

#### 2019: During PhD Physics, summa cum laude, [LMU](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html)

I started my Ph.D in July 10th, 2014 which ended on April 4th, 2019. During these 5 years I worked on developing a new technique for [imaging valence electron of crystalline solids](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/24081/1/Lakhotia_Harshit.pdf) such as $MgF_2$ and $CaF_2$. The time I was submitted my thesis I had no first author paper. Only research work I had published was by helping a former Phd student. I had not written a single paper on the topic I was working on for 5 year. I felt like my PhD was great failure because I was submitting the thesis without a single paper. In the final year of my PhD I was seriously depressed. I used to wake up midnight and start thinking about the bleak future I have. Finally all ended well. The 5 years of work is finally published in Nature in 2020. 

#### 2014: Before getting into [MPQ](https://www.mpq.mpg.de/)

- Rejected from optics program of 8 US universities which included University of Colorado Boulder, University of Florida, Rochester University (accepted fro Master's program though), Purdue University, Rice university, UIUC
- Accepted in EPFL and Swiss Govt. Excellence Fellowship. But this result came much after I had accepted the offer from MPQ
- At some point I was thinking of accepting the offer from Georgia State University because that was the first offer I received after a lot of rejections. It was right that I waited a bit and finally got into much better research institute.

#### 2009: Before getting into [IISER, Kol](www.iiserkol.ac.in)
IISER Kolkata, is one of the best schools for studying science in India.  However, before getting into this one. I studied engineering for a year at NIT Srinagar, Kashmir, India because I failed the entrance examination in 2008. I reappeared in 2009 and managed to pass by a very thin margin.


#### Extracurricular failures
- Failed to master Harmonica because can never find enough time ot practise. Still not confident to play it in any gathering. 
- Almost 30 years of age but still planing on taking driving lessons.
- Failed to learn German. Currently at A2 level.
