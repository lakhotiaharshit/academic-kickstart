Namaste! <em class="fas fa-praying-hands fa-fw"> </em> I am Harshit Lakhotia, which isn't just a name but a promise of 'Happiness' in Hindi. See that vibrant snapshot on the top-right. That's me, caught in a merry chase behind my wife on the cobbled streets of Barcelona. While my roots reach deep into the Indian soil, I've found a new home amidst Amsterdam's serene canals.

Since childhood I dreamt of becoming scientist.  This led me on a journey to dive deep into the world of Physics. I earned my Ph.D. from [MPQ](www.mpq.mpg.de), mastering the attosend ultfrast optics, and my foundational BS-MS from [IISER, Kolkata](www.iiserkol.ac.in).

My professional journey took a detour into the tech world, where I coded as a software developer at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/solutions/quantum-computing/technology/). Later, the allure of finance led me to model validation, first at [ABN AMRO](https://www.abnamro.com/) and now, as the Lead Validator at [Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.com/), ensuring that our models stand robust in preventing society against financial economic crime.
